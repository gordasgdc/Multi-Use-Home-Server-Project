# HomeServer
The purpose of this repository is to document and share my experience with building a multi-purpose Linux server.
My plan for this server is to use it as a web server and a cloud file server. 
I will be using **Fedora 30 Server** edition on a scrapped computer I build and deploying it in my household. 
# Installing the ISO
I retreieved the ISO image from the official Fedora website *https://getfedora.org/en/server/download/* and used a tool called **Rufus**.
Rufus is an easy to use ISO image writer *https://rufus.ie/*. After writing the ISO to a 4GB flash drive, I installed it into my machine and followed the installation GUI.
